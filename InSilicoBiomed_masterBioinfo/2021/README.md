# Biomedicina in silico - Master in Bioinformatics - Universitat de Valencia

Here can be found the materials used in the session of footprint analysis 
for omics functional analyis imparted by Julio Saez-Rodriguez's group in 
the subject of Biomedicina in silico.

The session covers both theoretical and functional analysis using footprint approaches.
Students learn about the use DoRothEA, PROGENy and CARNIVAL.

Prerequesites: install latest git, Rstudio and R, and CPLEX (optionally Cytoscape)
