# Biomedicina in silico - Master in Bioinformatics - Universitat de Valencia

Here can be found the materials used in the session of footprint analysis 
for omics functional analyis imparted by Julio Saez-Rodriguez's group in 
the subject of Biomedicina in silico.

The session covers both theoretical and functional analysis using footprint approaches.
Students learn about the use DoRothEA, PROGENy and CARNIVAL.

We will mainly use [FUNKi](https://saezlab.shinyapps.io/funki/), an Rshiny tool which implements all functional analysis ([Hernansaiz-Ballesteros et al 2021](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btac055)).

Prerequesites: install latest git, Rstudio and R. CPLEX and Cytoscape are optionals (only if run it locally)
